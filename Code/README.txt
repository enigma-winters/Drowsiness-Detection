1.Train model using modtrain.ipynb
(File size too big to upload on github).

2.Run mlproject.ipynb for drowsiness detection

3.Run demo.ipynb for liveness detection.
(shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat is too big to upload on github(95 mb), can be easily found on internet)

4.In test.ipynb we have integrated both, but there is a bit of lag and due to this the accuracy decreases.
